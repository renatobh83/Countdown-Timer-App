We all have important events we look forward to in life, birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays to name a few. Wouldn't it be nice to have an app that counts down the  days, hours, minutes, and seconds to an event? Countdown Timer is just that app!

The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing display of the he days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered event.
